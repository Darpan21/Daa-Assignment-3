*  Maximum Units on a Truck. Leetcode problem number: 1710

def maximum_units(boxTypes, truckSize):
    """
    Calculates the maximum number of units that can be transported on the truck.

    Args:
        boxTypes: A list of pairs (numBoxes, unitsPerBox), representing the number of boxes and units per box for each box type.
        truckSize: The maximum number of boxes the truck can hold.

    Returns:
        The maximum number of units that can be transported.
    """

    boxTypes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    total_units = 0
    for numBoxes, unitsPerBox in boxTypes:
        if numBoxes <= truckSize:
            total_units += numBoxes * unitsPerBox
            truckSize -= numBoxes
        else:
            total_units += truckSize * unitsPerBox
            break

    return total_units

# Example usage
boxTypes = [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1]]
truckSize = 4
max_units = maximum_units(boxTypes, truckSize)
print("Maximum units on the truck:", max_units)

Explanation:

Sort: Sort the boxTypes list in descending order based on the unitsPerBox. This ensures that we load the boxes with the highest number of units per box first.
Iterate: Iterate through the sorted boxTypes list.
Load Boxes: If the number of boxes of the current type (numBoxes) is less than or equal to the remaining truck capacity (truckSize), load all the boxes of that type and update the remaining capacity.
Load Partially: If the number of boxes of the current type exceeds the remaining truck capacity, load as many boxes as possible to fill the truck completely.
Calculate Total Units: Calculate the total number of units loaded onto the truck.

Output:

Maximum units on the truck: 11
