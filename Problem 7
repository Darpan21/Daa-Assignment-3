Explanation:

Initialize: Initialize five_dollar_bills and ten_dollar_bills to 0.
Iterate: Iterate through the bills list.
Handle $5 Bill: If the current bill is $5, increment five_dollar_bills.
Handle $10 Bill: If the current bill is $10, check if there's at least one $5 bill. If so, decrement five_dollar_bills and increment ten_dollar_bills. Otherwise, return False as change cannot be made.
Handle $20 Bill: If the current bill is $20, check if there's at least one $5 bill and one $10 bill, or if there are at least three $5 bills. If either condition is met, make the change and update the counters. Otherwise, return False.
Return Result: After processing all bills, return True if change could be made for every bill, False otherwise.

Output:

Can make change: True
