* Assign Cookies. (Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give
your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one
cookie.) Leetcode problem number: 455

def findContentChildren(g, s):
    # Sort the greed factors and cookie sizes
    g.sort()
    s.sort()
    
    child_i = 0  # Pointer for children
    cookie_i = 0  # Pointer for cookies
    
    # Loop until we reach the end of either array
    while child_i < len(g) and cookie_i < len(s):
        # If the current cookie can satisfy the current child
        if s[cookie_i] >= g[child_i]:
            child_i += 1  # Move to the next child
        cookie_i += 1  # Move to the next cookie

    # The number of satisfied children
    return child_i

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    g = [1, 2, 3]  # Greed factors of children
    s = [1, 1]     # Sizes of cookies
    satisfied_children = findContentChildren(g, s)
    print(f"Number of satisfied children: {satisfied_children}")
